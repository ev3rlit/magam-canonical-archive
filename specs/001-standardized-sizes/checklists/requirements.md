# Specification Quality Checklist: Standardized Size Language

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Baseline sizing table (`xs~xl`, Tailwind 3.4.3 기준) is explicitly documented in `spec.md`
- [x] Ratio contract and fallback are explicit (`landscape | portrait | square`, unsupported ratio -> warning + `landscape` fallback)

## Notes

- Validation pass: iteration 2
- No unresolved clarification markers
- Ready for `/speckit.plan`
